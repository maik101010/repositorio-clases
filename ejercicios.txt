    Print the details of the oldest and youngest worker.


Exercise 4: Calculate Average Age by Gender

Objective: Calculate the average age of workers grouped by gender.

    Create a list of Worker instances.

    Print the results.

Exercise 5: Convert Workers to a Set of Names

Objective: Convert the list of workers to a Set<String> containing only their names, removing duplicates.
